# The Five Stages of Debugging

Let's talk about the emotional rollercoaster that every developer knows too
well: debugging. It's like going through the five stages of grief, except with
more caffeine and Stack Overflow tabs.

## Stage 1: Denial

"It's not a bug, it's a feature." "The code is perfect; it must be the
compiler." "It worked on my machine five minutes ago!"

## Stage 2: Anger

```typescript
console.log('WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS');
console.log('SERIOUSLY WHY');
console.log('I HATE EVERYTHING');
console.log('ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬');
```

## Stage 3: Bargaining

- "Dear Git, if you can just show me which commit broke this..."
- "I'll delete all my node_modules if this works"
- "I promise to write tests next time"

## Stage 4: Depression

```typescript
// Maybe I'm not cut out for this
// Maybe I should become a farmer
// At least vegetables don't throw runtime errors
```

## Stage 5: Acceptance

Finally discovering it was a missing semicolon all along. Or worse, finding out
you spent six hours debugging code that was actually working, but you were
testing the wrong file.

## The Aftermath

The bug is fixed, and you feel like a genius. Time to commit with a message
like:

```git
git commit -m "Fixed critical bug (changed a > to a >= don't ask)"
```

Remember: It's not about how many bugs you create, it's about how creatively you
fix them. Now excuse me while I go add more console.logs to production.

P.S. If you're reading this while debugging something, yes, you should restart
your server.
