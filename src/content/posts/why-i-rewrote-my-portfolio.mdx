title: 'Why I Rewrote My Portfolio (Again)'
summary:
  'A tale of procrastination, perfectionism, and probably too much coffee'

It's that time of the year again. You know, when developers worldwide
collectively decide that their perfectly functional portfolios need a complete
rewrite. And guess what? I'm no exception.

## The Inevitable Cycle

1. Look at portfolio
2. Think "this is fine"
3. See a cool new framework/library
4. _"this is fine" meme starts burning_
5. Complete rewrite

## But Why Though?

Because apparently, I needed my website to be:

- 0.0003ms faster
- Built with the latest framework that will probably be outdated by the time you
  read this
- Dark mode (because we're all vampires now)
- Type-safe (because seeing red squiggly lines in VS Code gives me anxiety)

## The Real Reason

Let's be honest - I just wanted to procrastinate on my actual projects. There's
something therapeutically satisfying about rewriting your own website for the
47th time. It's like cleaning your room when you should be studying for exams.

## The Tech Stack

- Next.js (because React wasn't complicated enough)
- TypeScript (because I hate myself)
- Tailwind (because writing CSS is so 2020)
- MDX (because regular markdown wasn't fancy enough)

## Conclusion

Will I rewrite it again? Probably. Did I need to rewrite it? Absolutely not. Am
I happy with it? Until I see another cool GitHub repo, yes.

Remember folks, the best portfolio is the one that's actually online. Now excuse
me while I go rewrite this blog post in Rust.
