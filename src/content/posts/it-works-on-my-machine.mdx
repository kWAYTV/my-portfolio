# It Works on My Machine‚Ñ¢

Ah, the four words that strike fear into the hearts of developers everywhere.
Let's explore this timeless phenomenon that's been haunting code reviews since
the dawn of time.

## The Natural Habitat

Picture this: You've just pushed your code. CI is green. Tests pass. Life is
good. Then:

```bash
QA: "The app crashes on startup"
You: "That's impossible, works on my machine"
QA: "Well, I'm looking at a black screen"
You: "BUT IT WORKS ON MY MACHINE!"
```

## The Developer's Checklist

- ‚úÖ Works on my local
- ‚úÖ Works in dev environment
- ‚úÖ Works in my dreams
- ‚ùå Works in production

## The Investigation

```typescript
// The code you wrote
const config = {
  port: 3000,
  dbPath: 'C:/Users/YourName/perfect/setup/db',
  nodeModules: 'definitely/installed/correctly'
};

// What production actually sees
const config = {
  port: undefined,
  dbPath: '404_not_found',
  nodeModules: 'what_node_modules?'
};
```

## The Classic Solutions

1. "Have you tried clearing your cache?"
2. "Let me push a quick hotfix" (narrator: it was not quick)
3. "Must be a Docker issue"
4. The nuclear option: "Works on my machine, let's ship my machine"

## The Real Fix

After 6 hours of debugging:

```diff
- const port = process.env.PORT;
+ const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

## Conclusion

Remember: "Works on my machine" is not a deployment strategy. Though if anyone's
interested, I am working on a startup that ships developer machines to
production environments. Currently seeking Series A funding.

P.S. If this post doesn't display correctly, try clearing your cache. Works on
my machine! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
